I am [research professor][simhome] of Data-Driven Software Engineering at [Simula Research Laboratory][simula] in Norway. [Contact me][contact] if you are interested in discussing opportunities to work with us on [addressing concrete software engineering needs in industry and society][research] based on fundamental research results.

Before moving to Norway, I was [assistant professor][tudhome] in the [Software Evolution Research Lab][swerl] at [Delft University of Technology][tud], the Netherlands, and researcher in (what is now) the [Software Analysis and Transformation][swat] group at the [Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI)][cwi] in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Collaborations in both these groups have helped to shape my research interests in exploring novel techniques that are aimed at addressing real-life software engineering challenges. 

I am co-founder of the [Software Improvement Group (SIG)][sig], a company that helps organizations deal with software (legacy) issues by means of automatic source code analysis, software risk assessments, software monitoring and automatic (re)generation of technical documentation based on source code analysis. Starting with a small team of 6 people in 2000, SIG has grown to employ over 100 people in 2017 and became a key player in evidence-based software quality improvement.
