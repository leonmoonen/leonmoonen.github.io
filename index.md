    text: "Welcome to my homepage! <BR>I am a professor in Software Engineering at Simula Research Laboratory, Norway. My research is aimed at the development and empirical evaluation of advanced data-driven techniques and tools that help software engineers create more secure, trustworthy and resilient systems. The focus is on creating actionable, evidence-based, insights for assessing and understanding the risks involved with the evolution and operation of complex software-intensive systems. My research combines several fields, such as software analysis, machine learning and AI, software reverse engineering, software repository mining, program comprehension, and empirical software engineering.<BR><BR>In collaboration with my team, I'm currently addressing the following areas: (1) cybersecurity, in particular, automated assessment and repair of software security vulnerabilities, as well as automated support for cyber threat intelligence; (2) autonomous self-healing systems, where we investigate how bio-inspired approaches can help build more resilient systems; and (3) intelligent analytics, to benefit from the wealth of data that is produced during software development, evolution and operation to support decision-making."
