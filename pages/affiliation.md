I am a [professor][simhome] and head of the [Data-Driven Software Engineering Department][datased] at [Simula Research Laboratory][simula] in Oslo, Norway. I also hold a visiting professor position at the [Department of Data Science and Analytics][bidept] at [BI Norwegian Business School][bihome].

[Contact me][contact] if you are interested in discussing opportunities to work with us on [addressing concrete software engineering needs in industry and society][research] based on evidence-based research results.

Before moving to Norway, I worked in the [Software Evolution Research Lab][swerl] at [Delft University of Technology][tud], the Netherlands, and in (what is now) the [Software Analysis and Transformation][swat] group at the [Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI)][cwi] in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Collaborations in both these groups have helped to shape my research interests in exploring novel techniques that are aimed at addressing real-life software engineering challenges. 

I am co-founder of the [Software Improvement Group (SIG)][sig], a company that helps organizations deal with software (legacy) issues by means of automatic source code analysis, software risk assessments, software monitoring and automatic (re)generation of technical documentation based on source code analysis. Starting with a small team of 6 people in 2000, SIG has grown to employ over 150 people in 2022 and became a key player in evidence-based software quality improvement.
