    text: "Welcome to my homepage! <BR>I am a researcher in Software Engineering. My research is aimed at the development and empirical evaluation of advanced data-driven techniques and tools to help software engineers create more secure, trustworthy and resilient systems. The focus is on creating actionable, evidence-based, insights for assessing and understanding the risks involved with the evolution and operation of complex software-intensive systems.<BR><BR>Currently ongoing work addresses the following areas: (1) cybersecurity, in particular, automated assessment and repair of software security vulnerabilities; (2) autonomous self-healing systems, where we investigate how bio-inspired approaches can help build more resilient systems; and (3) intelligent analytics, to benefit from the wealth of data that is produced during software development, evolution and operation to support decision-making.<BR><BR>My research combines several subfields of computing, such as software analytics, software reverse engineering, software repository mining, machine learning, program comprehension, and empirical software engineering."
