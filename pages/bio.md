Leon Moonen is a Research Professor of Data-Driven Software Engineering at Simula Research Laboratory, Norway.  
His research is aimed at the design and development of advanced, 
data-driven techniques and tools that support software engineers with the assessment, 
evolution, and operations of complex industrial software systems, 
with a particular interest in Security and Resilience in Software Systems, 
Self-Healing and Self-Adaptive Technology and, more general, 
the Application of Machine Learning in Software Engineering. 
His research covers a wide range of topics, such as software analytics, 
software reverse engineering, software repository mining, machine learning, 
program comprehension, and empirical software engineering. 

Leon prefers to work in close collaboration with industry, 
to ensure that his research addresses questions of practical value, 
and to evaluate candidate solutions in real-life circumstances. 
Current projects investigate automated identification and repair of software security vulnerabilities, 
adaptive bio-inspired techniques for creating autonomously self-healing systems, 
intelligent analytics of the vast amounts of logging data produced in continuous engineering,
and recommendation systems for smarter evolution and testing of software-intensive systems. 

Dr. Moonen has published over 120 scientific papers (over 4850 citations, h-index: 34, i10-index: 60) 
and serves on steering-, organizing-, and program committees of international conferences on software maintenance (ICSM/ICSME), reverse engineering (WCRE), program understanding (ICPC), and source code analysis (SCAM) and he has (co-)organized various workshops on topics related to these areas. 
Before moving to Simula, he was assistant professor of Software Engineering at Delft University of Technology 
where he taught courses on software evolution and software architecture. 
He has been advisor to 8 PhD students, 6 Post-docs and 18 MSc students. 
He is co-founder of the Software Improvement Group, a company that specializes in the use of source code analysis to help organizations get control over their software systems. 
Dr Moonen received his MSc (cum laude, Computer Science, 1996) and PhD (Computer Science, 2002) from the University of Amsterdam. 
He is a member of ACM, IEEE Computer Society, EAPLS and the ERCIM Working Group on Software Evolution.
